# Beam Search Pathfinding in C++

This project demonstrates **Beam Search** applied to a simple maze/pathfinding problem.  
It uses a grid map with walls, free paths, and a start/destination.

---

## Features
- Beam Search implementation in **C++**
- Uses **Manhattan distance** as the heuristic
- Console-based visualization:
  - ðŸŸ¥ Red â†’ Destination
  - ðŸŸ© Green â†’ Visited path
  - â¬œ White â†’ Walls
  - â¬› Black â†’ Free path

---
1 = Wall
0 = Free path

## Example Map
{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
{1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1},
{1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1},
{1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1},
{1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1},
{1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1},
{1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1},
{1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1},
{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}

## GOAL

Start â†’ `(1,1)`  
Destination â†’ `(7,7)`
