# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe â€“ Math-Based Implementations

This repository contains **two unique implementations of Tic Tac Toe** using mathematical tricks instead of traditional board checking.  
It is written in **C++** .

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Magic Square Method

### ðŸ§  Logic
- A **3Ã—3 Magic Square** is used, where every row, column, and diagonal sums to **15**:
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2

- Each cell in the Tic Tac Toe board is mapped to one of these numbers.
- A player **wins if the sum of any 3 chosen numbers = 15**.
- Instead of checking rows/columns/diagonals explicitly, we just check combinations of numbers chosen by a player.

### ðŸ“Œ Example
- X selects `8, 1, 6` â†’ sum = 15 â†’ **X wins**.
- O selects `4, 5, 6` â†’ sum = 15? No â†’ **Game continues**.

âœ… This reduces the win-checking problem to a **subset-sum problem**.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Multiplication / Prime Trick Method

### ðŸ§  Logic
Each board state is represented by numbers:
- Empty â†’ **2**
- X â†’ **3**
- O â†’ **5**

We use multiplication to detect wins:
- `3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 = 27` â†’ 3 Xâ€™s â†’ **X wins**  
- `5 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 = 125` â†’ 3 Oâ€™s â†’ **O wins**  
- `2 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 = 18` â†’ X about to win â†’ block required  
- `2 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 = 50` â†’ O about to win â†’ play to win  

### ðŸ“Œ Example
- Line: `X, X, _` â†’ product = 18 â†’ X close to winning â†’ block.  
- Line: `O, O, _` â†’ product = 50 â†’ O close to winning â†’ take winning move.  

âœ… This avoids complex `if` conditions â†’ just check **products**.
